# Alloy Substance Painter Shaders
Alloy has preview shaders designed to work with Allegorithmic's Substance Painter tool to provide a mostly accurate preview of how the resulting material set will look in Unity using Alloy. This code is provided AS IS with no support guarantees beyond attempting to keep pace with new Substance Painter releases.

### Usage

1. Go to your "Documents" folder and locate the "Substance Painter" folder.
2. Navigate to "..\Documents\Substance Painter\shelf\shaders".
3. Copy the "Substance Painter Custom Shader.zip" file from your Alloy project packages directory into the "..\shaders" folder.
4. Extract the file contents here so that the "*.glsl" files are in this folder.
5. Open up Substance Painter, and confirm that the "Alloy" shaders are available in your shelf.
